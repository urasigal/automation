Single test architecture:

1 Test class name convention:
	Each test class has to end with a "Test" suffix.
	Each test class has to begin with a prefix that point to a test object's host product - feeder, broadcaster, receiver ...
	The second part of the test's name has to describe the object of the test.
	
	Test hierarchy:
	
	Each test case class has to inherit from the "BaseTest" class.
	
	Test flow:
	
	Each test has a testNG's @BeforeClass testInit method - instantiates a test driver class. 
	Each test has at least a test @Test method.
	Each test has a @BeforeMethod beforeTes(String testid) method - provides a logger class.
	Each test has @AfterMethod public void afterTest(Method test, ITestResult result) method.
